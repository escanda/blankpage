Do you remember the headlines over the bombings in Spanish trains in Madrid like in El pozo del tio Raimundo or Atocha? They were linked to ETA
and the security services under the umbrella of both Guardia Civil and Policia Nacional called CGI. They were robbed from two mines Mina Conchita
and another mine. The operatives under Trashorras and Carmen Toro - she even earned 1 million euros because the trial and was not even incarcerated -
were trained into thinking they were an ETA command but in reality they only were some madlings from the very same mines they robbed with policemen aid.

This point is not stressed enough. They were not a political movement. They were just used through lodge by means of scam. The most common argument being you are being loved but I love you as you are and come; but they tell you what to do.

So yes,Trashorras and his team were the ones who delivered almost 60KG of C2 explosives to Madrid by Alsa bus to the muslim operatives junctioned by the
information service, or CNI; and these muslim operatives captained by Yamal. After gathering with them in a McDonalds. It was not even a McDonalds as there
are no recordings of this meeting. But they liaed in justice court as they were told, and the lie was accepted by Bermudez in the Audiencia Nacional.

The one who traveled with them in a bag was the protector and lover of Carmen Toro - now mother but divorced from Emilio Suarez Trashorras. He brought
the bag to Jamal Zougan's squad.you watch all them declare to court [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p15tIioeP8Q&list=PL086E66B8B353FA41). Jamal's
people then moved the explosives into their homes and zulos; but _the actual detonation does not seem related_, it seems more likely they were carried out
by a different team of professionals: who were blowed up in two explosions, one by them and the other by GEO of police so they could die and don't speak freely.

Of interest in the court declaration of them are how they lie "online" and how the judge is partial to the terrorists under the excuse of them only carrying
out the explosives travelling and custody, both by Trashorras and Jamal; but not planting them: there were no arrests at the time of the bombings.

Instead, the actual bomb exploders were executed so they coudln't speak how they obtained them in a Leganes flat: GEO planted some bombs and in the meanwhile they were tortured in lodge.

Interersting to me is how they could, Trashorras in particular - he recognizes he is schizoprenic - be trained and at the same time meet with CGI and Guardia Civil
with no consequences under the pretext of being drug traffickers: they were given hashisch by El Chino related to the Tunda Tunda of Gijon: Ivan and Amparo
the owners being linked closely related to officers.

Another interesting fact is that El Chino - by El Mundo at the time - was stopped by Guardia Civil de Trafico in a highway with no documentation and more explosives
but was let go the connection he had and the charge he was given.

I am really impressed - after being torured myself - what kind of pscyhodrama these teams were given so they could transport and store explosives; and later on, accussed of exploding those bombs.

An amateur could think the news were true, but even doumbers can realize from the justice court footage linked above that instead this was State terrorism.
