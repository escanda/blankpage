Dead within, or dead without. Those are the rulings of the famille. The famille is those people in lodge you don't see but can talk to, feel and influence.

Those might kill you some day or maybe tomorrow. You might kill them if you were like them. Those rules must be considered and respected: you are game and you will end up dead sometime.

Once dead, since you already passed to lodge, you will live 100 years of solitude - as Gabriel Garcia Marquez once wrote. You will be remembered and oblitered to dead by your opinions,
your findings or your real world influence: as in real dinasties which are yet today questioned about actual matters; thus pyramids.

Rules must be followed and people must be obligued into obedience.

Influence and its kin, assassination, are closely related to spionage, being the most common suicide by defenestration.

You might have seen in Hollywood spy movies where they intervene with a full glock auto but most of the time - field agents - are supported by a myriad of different profiles communicating
in lodge. They share intuition, knowledge and resources with no neccessity of meeting in space.

These are not closed loop circuits. Sometimes external people to lodge - thus the nomenclature and its belonging - come into play to watch out for information and ways to influence or
manipulate an operation: the most common behavior in such cases is to stop talking and removal of the threat.

So, wait, what is lodge? Did you hear of freemasonry? Then you got it right. People passed into lodge can coommunicate, sense and feel in non common ways and things so you may never know
what is the person at your side willing or able to do.

We have got into two games so far, where the latter cannot be conceived without trying the first: influcence and appearance. Although appearance is only key to those not in the known or missing
information about your persona or your intent, it is a mandatory so you don't get caught nor you become a suspect.

This issue is really important once you have passed into lodge since you will be harshly tried and manipulated as if you were living a psychodrama of some sort. This is a tough estance newcomers
of all kinds face alike as fucked up, and some of them, suicide because they cannot cope.

I lived this stuff myself and I still live it day by day since drama is part of game it is what is played in "the field". I cope. It is not easy. I might end up dead at some point. This
working knowledge must not be forgotten at any time since this falacy can be leveraged and abused by third party actors. It is tactical and wise to keep you head over your shoulders and work out
self-coping mechanisms aligned to your: 1. personal goals 2. lodge goals and 3. special interest group goals.

Lodge scope and targets vary from lodge to lodge, and from person to person and also by people groups. You have to keep an eye at the global picture of what you want to achieve in your intimate world
and *most important* what you want to keep sane in your ethics or morals - or whatever you want to call inner laws of sense and being sensible to yourself. Whenever you treason you inner beliefs
you might get closer to being killed.
