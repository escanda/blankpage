As I still remember the aliases of Belen Mesquida and Javier Gonzarri. They introduced
me properly - and some police officer called Leandro - into freemasonry.

They tried several times to end my life entirely. I still managed to survive.
Under the false pretense of being a criminal - but I have a clean criminal
record - I was fined two times, and that is that, which is enough to be fined.

Now, every now on them, people of the Bajo Mundo or low key as they say in
anglosaxon countries, even call me to threaten me, harrassment, we live in
Spain after all and it is a shitty country as a whole. Even the latest chief
of state, or the next, are just killers under the false pretense of legality
or even, power; or love. They just want you to commit to their objectives.

I know them personally within lodge. It is absurd up to what extent they are
just killers.
