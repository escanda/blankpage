Did you know constante alona was, and still rules its kin with dead and fear?
Yeah, this is Spain, and dead inside. The dead from the dead lodges rule the
living. Oh hail mi general Francisco Franco! <- this was heard in some tenida.

The royal dinasty of Galicia is still alive and kicking yo. You might end up
dead because of it, and they are already dead: the irony!

So, yes, this is Spain, fascism still works, and I might end up arrested because
telling you this; or demoted as if I were something worse than being dead: yo
die! They say.

Still, listen young prep, you will wind up dead if you don't get out of the
country. Take notes, as told you before, save money and escape while you can.

In the meanwhile, underwrite your life to the devil and advocate for the best:
these people murder and die, and you might not like it.

Whistleblowing should be a democratic right but it is not. I might end up
accussed of promoting terrorism (ha ha) or even pleading allegiance to fascism.

I am not doing that, avid public servant (ha ha).

So yes, I got my email scrutinized, some of those emails removed and they tried
to murder me sometimes.

This is a black country and we know it. It is a matter of time another war sheds
light into this wrongdoing country to kill some more citizens.

Who knows? ETA might end up alive again too. Rico rico, y con fundamento!

Jokes aside: I am dead serious in the eye: this country is full of people willing
to kill another human beings in the blink of an eye. It is sad but true.

Hence my problem.
