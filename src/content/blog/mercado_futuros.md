So yes, dear readers: Spain is planning a terrorist attack in its soil.
Even my mother, Elena is favorable to a massive killing in
Spanish soil, and it seems her opinions count. Her father was involved
in Eibar in the Chalcha restaurant as a coadjunt of the spanish fascist
forces and the ETA terrorist band: it was where part of the band greeted
officials and shared resources over military targets and civil attacks.

Myself, because I know her and her links to the spanish secret service - I am being threatened of dead by the spanish police, and even contractors, from time to time; for the time being I couldn't be violently
executed but I suffered from induction although I did not follow thus my
words.

Like the Alvia were 172 died in a tragedy - wait juas - no: it was not a
tragedy but a terrorist attack. In this time - moreover in Spain - is
quite comfy to use goverment employees as workforce for this kind of
stuff, since most of them "hear voices in their heads" you only need to
convince them they are someone they were not, but this new self can be
forwarded and focused into killings: like I explained before of
Trashorras where they thought they were an ETA operative instead of a
goverment allienated subject.

Otherwise you have to infiltrate in the culture of the subject you want
to force into effect and take it from there. It is why there are so many
acronyms: such as DAESH, or short words Jihad. Those are
sold to the common people as threats and to vulnerable subjects as an
opportunity to elevate themselves from the isolation and loneliness they
might be going through because their Visa status or their lack of economic
resources: you can research - altough I will write down some notes in
further episodes about 17A attacks.

This point is important in particular because all the effort it takes to
doblegate someone's will and more important, to crash a whole train at
full force, takes at least a year of continuous talking. He was informed as they say.

Well, these might be my last lines, but peaceful readers, I
love the world and it is a shame I might depart so early; but you might
get to know more truthful facts in following chapters.
