How is so warrior - police, military and intel - are so aligned towards continuing the fascist culture of the previous regime?

It seems unplausible if you don't know the deal but masonic rites reunite altogether across lodges as you might know. They host
a myriad of dead personalities and each state has many of them. So what is a masonic lodge then? Were the dead, or partfully dead, join
forces to cohort the living. Here in Spain we have the previous dictator in the main lodge establishing international connections
with translators across states.

Curious thing is fascism is forbidden here in Spain: you can go to prison if you were to exhaltate the dictatorship reign, but he speaks
freely and is cellebrated in circles from state related people and victims alike (since is common practice killing detractors here in
Spain, plus lots of tourists in Summer, in a fifo manner they land they die).

So why has this fascism endured more than 40 years in this soil? Well, it seems monarchy is really entrenched with current monarch towards 
the old values of fascism such as cult of fertility, cult of youth and killing those unwanted. We cannot forget Spain is just sand and some soil heavily blowed by inmigration, poverty and even famine: it was not so long ago before all people knew how to read; or had something
different than rats like in La Colmena of Camilo Jose Cela to eat.

Those who don't like the country must fly away before they eventually get killed because political opinions for instance. Particularly,
those passed to lodge so they can use them abroad. I couldn't trust any spaniard over any physical subject of State since you never know
who you are hiring: there a lot of passed to lodge people who are trained in stuff like terrorism so they can be later activated; like
in the cold war.

It seems immigration might not be that nice. I understand their alignment and life positions but it doesn't sum up too nicely in the
parasited states. Here in Europe you can feel we are getting deadlier and have a lessen life span because the lapse of ethical
values and democratic rules: that is why all this right winged parties and hard people are getting stitffer at this time. And it is not
because genes or because skin color: it is just the big number of population at play with a myriad ethnical values and its loose coupling
not playing out too well.

Life is at diamond's price these days and you can't allocate million inmigrants without a battle royale over basic things such as food or money: this is just as it is and if we were to observe Pedro Sanchez political party ideology and policy we could conclude there is no such
thing as eating your cake and keeping it too.

People die over these matters. Even the stupidest alive can observe - given the time - people live less and less each year dying of shit earlier.

But they know that. You can die being a younglin at 20 because you can't sustain a job and you get expelled from home to live on the streets:
I can remember a 21 year old girl who was begging on the street and living in a shelter who suicided promptly forward being on treatment: I
can't even remember her name but at least her mother had to endure the same treatment and died soon after.

You get pushed into treatment but you don't get a job nor a livable life. That is why fascism is also that shiny on this location: you can
kill as many as they come and they get severed; the other half can partake on popular films such as Marisol: a well behaved but deeply traumatized lolita.

I can't understand the driving force to give birth to some poor soul in this fucked up world. But, who cares? You can dump them
after abusing them on the streets and then call them ill people. Truth is they were sexually abused with no consequence, but well, not in 
this case since they both got dead in a small time window: forces at play.

They must be watching us from Alona praying the chorus of god: madness.
