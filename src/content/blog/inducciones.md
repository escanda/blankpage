Did you figure out if you were going to play a game the most sensible choice
could be fractioning your enemies through alliances? That is part of
how freemasonry system works. But, would you want to take part of such system
with no prior alliance? That's a key point everyone willing to underwrite
such losing game must think about.

Here in Spain, under the name of Constante Alona, the dead, like General Franco
still talk to their members giving them ideas of war, or peace, or just praising
some ideals of the past such as fascism; they even sing songs at once to members.

I was a member and was welcomed and congrated by General Franco and some real
dinasty monarch of the time being. The rite consisted in being congrated and
welcomed by these authorities as if you were graduating university and you were
getting a diploma.

All those name registers, amount balances and rites are nothing but something
to take from their inferior or newer members. If you were forced, as I were,
you could only pray for them to be enough so you don't die yourself.

Plus all these figures only want to remain relevant across generations by
subsidizing inferior members into allegiance and curiosity about them.

Since if you had some ethics you couldn't play such game: how would you sum up
balance in this fractional zero sum game? By treason of ethics. Becoming one
of them, which in plain sight is someone who harras - which is just a tactic
to kill someone through suicide induction up to defenestration.

Since you will need to meet some obligations you didn't even entertain in your
imagination; or else, end up dead. That is something you won't get tell. Under
the appearance of words such as compromise, subjective experience or blunt
promises you will get subsumized to obedience and debt.

It is like a ponzi game where the higher ranks fraction their "brethen" riches
into their pockets, or even, just their lives: such as the masonic rite of
killing someone after setting up stones in their pockets and throwing them
into the sea or water: just as if you sailed through compromise and morals but
you end up dead in some hole. Summarized it is just that.

The people in the higher ranks go up killing their inferiors and promising them
business opportunities or blunt money in exchange of something: a devil's
deal since they will go behind your back making and collecting older debts
so they can take your assets or your life.

It is a unmerful game. Highly illegal. Induction is a crime. Crimes are
felonies. Killing someone is - here in Spain - sanctioned with 3 years and
6 months of federal prison.

All days there are people suiciding themselves because a) they are bankrupt
b) they thought they were loved and they lose that and some, so they get killed
c) they are so harrased and miserable they are inducted into suicide by 1)
the most common is defenestration 2) people who are not willing to cooperate
might end up being killed aggresively by 1) a payed mercenary or assassin
2) a close traitor who poisons them.

About this last point you have to understand people get trained into
assasination through explosives, fireguns and other means such as knifes.
Being the most common getting poisoned. Some people get trained in things
like Ricin and such poisons; as if they were a KGB agent of some sort.

I cannot tell you what I was trained in but it was really similar to the
previous poison I mentioned. They call it a fraternity of moral people but
it is not that: if you get to the exact meaning of it, it is just people
being morals, as in not ethical, just creating a culture of exploitation and
baseness; with the intrinsic promise of getting eventually killed.

I have met because of this issue a lot of prominent figures which once you
knew them, they were just killers, or scum.

You will get embodied into this criminal assortment and treated like scum
just as they will be one day as soon as they get betrayed.
