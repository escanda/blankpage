Today is a simple Sunday made unbearable by the chatter the people at the Castilian intelligence center are having in the lodge, while I'm just trying to set up a fucking email server with PKCS#11 so they don't get in there and mess up the emails I send when looking for work or requesting international asylum: an international law.

Which amounts to an international crime. In addition to all the homicides Alona adds in terms of inducement and assignment.

And they've already started deleting my emails when I've inquired about the possibilities of expatriation through international asylum; I'm going to have to send them again.

Because of the fact that the CNI has been training me in terrorism for nefarious purposes.

It's curious, but Franco can't speak with international management without intermediaries; even to this day. And then it's a crime to praise the dictator when he co-governs in Freemasonry with Uchia, the monarch.

I still remember my Amazon account being stolen, detailing purchases of explosive materials during the investigation, such as gas masks, laboratory equipment, and substances used to synthesize certain topics. And all this without any police intervention at my home.

Now they're telling me to leave and all that. Conclusion: be careful, these people are fucking sadists. Psychopaths who commit suicide every day. Then, when they're harassed by their fucking cronies, they commit suicide: garbage. I've heard about 40 people commit suicide already. The very same Crown Princess tried to kill me—so they say—because of my opinions. What a murderer.

Threats to kill me, accusations of random crimes—from rapist to the worst. My morale is falling with this harassment.

There's no way I can make money like this.

By the way, did you know that Constante Alona is the Masonic branch where the gypsy patriarch Francisco Franco resides? With the current monarch. It's a big deal, kid.

SPAIN NEEDS A NEW IDEA OF WHAT SPAIN SHOULD BE -> words of Franco's fascist-like opponent speaking with Belén Mesquida akka and Javier Gonzarri akka; in the lodge.

Well, yes, as harsh as it may be, the CNI and the Constante Alona lodge have tried to assassinate me by poisoning and inducement. Constante Alona is the lodge represented by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, or CNI.
